# gym-2048

Open AI gym environment for the game 2048 and agents to play it.

## Getting Started

This project contains an Open AI gym environment for the game 2048 (in directory gym-2048) and some agents and tools to learn to play it.

* `simple_rl_agent.py` - Simple RL agent which learns the quality of moves for a particular board state
* `train_deep_network.py` - Trains a deep neural network to play from SL data
* `gather_training_data.py` - records training data to train neural network from in CSV form

Other training_data files are for manipulating the training data.
